            <p>    I am a professionally trained leader and salesman. <br />
                 I am a self-motivated, “go-getter”. I thoroughly enjoy <br />
                 a challenging project and am always looking for something <br />
                 new to tackle and learn about. I have always enjoyed design, <br />
                 architecture, world building, and interface design since as far <br />
                 as I can remember. It has always interested me and I am usually <br />
                 the go-to person in my friend group and family that decides just <br />
                 how something should look or be organized. I am currently <br />
                 enrolled at Georgia Tech learning to be a UI/UX Designed at one <br />
                 of their bootcamps designed as such.</p>
